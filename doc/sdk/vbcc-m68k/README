vbcc multi-target binary distribution

This is a binary distribution of vbcc/vasm that allows
cross-compilation and cross-assembly to a variety of targets
supported by vbcc/vasm. Note that for some targets (notably
6502-based and Amiga/Atari OSs) there are separate
distributions with extra support (samples, installation scripts
etc.).

The following architectures are supported:

- 6502/65C02: vasm + vbcc
  libc: C64, C128, PET, Atari 8bit, BBC Micro/Master
        NES, MEGA65, Commander X16,

- 6809/6309/68hc12: vasm + vbcc
  libc: simulator/freestanding, OS9 (tbc), Vectrex (tbc)

- 6800/6801/6803/6808/68hc11: vasm

- C16X/ST10: vasm + vbcc
  libc: MM167, freestanding

- Coldfire: vasm + vbcc
  libc: MINT, Arnewsh 5206

- i386: vasm + vbcc
  libc: Linux, NetBSD, DOS (tbc)

- M68k: vasm + vbcc
  libc: AmigaOS, Atari TOS, MINT, Atari Jaguar, Linux

- PowerPC: vasm + vbcc
  libc: AmigaOS, PowerUp, WarpOS, MorphOS
        Linux, NetBSD, OpenFirmware

- QNICE: vasm + vbcc
  libc: monitor, freestanding

- VideoCore IV (RasperryPi GPU): vasm + vbcc
  libc: Linux (probably outdated), freestanding

- DEC Alpha: vbcc
  libc: compatible with Linux (probably outdated)

- 832 FPGA: vbcc
  libc: n/a

- ARM: vasm

- Jaguar RISC: vasm

- PDP11: vasm

- TR3200: vasm

- Z80: vasm

- Infocom Z-machine: vbcc
  libc: n/a



To use the compiler on Windows:

  set VBCC=<path-to-vbcc-dir>
  set PATH=%VBCC%\bin;%PATH%

On Linux, use something like:

  export VBCC=<path-to-vbcc-dir>
  export PATH=$VBCC/bin:"$PATH"

Compiling works pretty much like most compilers, e.g.:

  vc +<target> file.c -o binary

For <target> substitute one of the available target
configurations from the config subdirectory.

Further information on vbcc can be found on

  http://www.compilers.de/vbcc

and in the vbcc.pdf included here. Apart from the general sections on
the compiler, be sure to have a look at the ones for the CPU backend
you are using and the section for your target in the C library chapter.
