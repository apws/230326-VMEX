As we will probably design sidecar extension to the Z80Retro! pure Z80 bus
for retro-fusion 3V3 operation to allow running system with predefined set of peripherals
by many different processors (only memory mapped IO defined by peripheral MCU with
switchable MMU memory mappiongs for different processors, OR even switchable for memory
or IO instrucitons? 256 ports max defined, identically mapped to memory ??)

here are BEST CPM22 links (nice semantical description of BIOS and BDOS functions + apps)

here is also one of BEST CPM22 emulators
http://www.shaels.net/index.php/z80emu

here is probably BEST Z80 mini system (using 3V3 parallax propeller as peripheral chip)
http://www.shaels.net/index.php/mini80

here is probably BEST and FASTEST possible CPM22 system uzin EZ80 processors (50MHz)
http://www.shaels.net/index.php/mic80
(using extended EBIOS and remote networked disks by RDISK protocol)


here is ANSI terminal project, we will also use terminal in VMEX, probably simplified !!!

Sergej Kiselev Easy Z80 - very similar layout !!!
