RISC-V has screwed instruction compression in a very spectacular way, wasting opcodes on nonorthogonal floating point instructions - absolutely obsolete in the most chips where it really matters (embedded), and non-critical in the other (serious code uses vector extensions anyway).
It doesn't have critical (for code density and performance on low-spec cores) address modes: post/pre-incrementation.
Even adhering to strict 2r1w instruction design it could have stores with them.
